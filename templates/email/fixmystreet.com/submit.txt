FixMyStreet is an independent website, built by the charity mySociety(<https://www.mysociety.org/>) to make it easier for citizens to report problems in their community.

Do we have to receive email reports from FixMyStreet?

When FixMyStreet first launched in 2007 it was in response to many councils not offering an easy-to-use online reporting service. Many residents still prefer FixMyStreet because of its simplicity and because it removes the need for them to know which council is responsible for what problem. 

These days FixMyStreet acts as a national reporting platform, bringing all of the local authorities and government organisations together on one system, triaging reports between councils at all levels, highways agencies and housing associations. Local authorities no longer need to receive email reports from FixMyStreet as they can be integrated into existing council business systems - and there are a few different ways this can be achieved.


How can FixMyStreet connect directly with council systems?

1. You can do this yourself (for free) using our Open311 API
2. We can build and maintain the integration for you (carries an annual fee)
3. You can become a FixMyStreet Pro user. FixMyStreet Pro is a more advanced version of FixMyStreet, which seeks to eliminate the significant costs councils incur from duplicate reporting, unnecessary contact and failure demand (we have the stats to prove it!). 

As a charitable organisation our goal is to help improve services for citizens and local authorities. To find out more about connecting FixMyStreet to your own systems, please get in touch at <support@fixmystreet.com>.
