# Administrator tasks

If you find that you cannot perform any of the tasks detailed below when logged into your WasteWorks account, it is likely that your account has not been given the relevant permissions or role.

Contact your account administrator to request these permissions. Accompanying each task covered in this document, you will see ‘permissions required’, listing the permissions an Administrator must give you (either individually or via a role) for you to be able to perform this task.

## Further help

- If you’re a member of council staff using WasteWorks, questions about your account, role or permissions should be addressed to your Administrator.
- For any technical problems and queries, Administrators may contact the SocietyWorks team by raising a ticket through the helpdesk system.
