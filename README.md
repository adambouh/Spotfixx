Welcome to Spotfix: Empowering Communities for Positive Change
Welcome to the Spotfix open-source platform! Spotfix is a powerful project aimed at enabling communities to seamlessly report and address common anomalies and issues, fostering a culture of collaboration and improvement.

What is Spotfix?
Spotfix is a revolutionary platform designed to simplify the reporting of various issues, ranging from potholes to broken street lights. Users can effortlessly locate problems using a combination of addresses and interactive maps, eliminating concerns about reporting to the correct authority. Spotfix intelligently determines the appropriate authority based on the problem's location and type, facilitating efficient communication through email or web services like Open311.

Reported issues are visible to all users, ensuring transparency and enabling updates. Subscriptions for email or RSS alerts allow users to stay informed about problems in their area.
